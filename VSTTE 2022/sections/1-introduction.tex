\section{Introduction}




Our dataset is extracted from a collection of problems from CHC-COMP\footnote{\url{https://chc-comp.github.io/}}. The problems come from various sources (e.g., benchmarks generated with JayHorn\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chc-comp/jayhorn-benchmarks}} and differernt synthesis tools \footnote{\url{https://github.com/chc-comp/synthesis}}) and in total, there are 8705~linear and 8425~non-linear Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA) problems. More details are in the Table~1 of the competition report~\cite{chcBenchmark}. We integrate the learned relevant filter to the model checker Eldarica~\cite{ruemmer2013disjunctive} with various strategy. The experimental results show that our framework can solve problems that cannot be solved before and decrease the solving time for solvable problems.


\paragraph{Contributions of the paper.}
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item We build a end-to-end framework which integrates a pre-trained relevant filter for the interpolation queries to obtain better abstractions in CEGAR-based Horn solver.
  \item We explore various CHC graph representations to capture different aspects of syntactic and semantic information and the ways of using the relevant filter. 
  \item We evaluate our framework on the CHC-COMP benchmark and show that this framework assists the CEGAR-based Horn solvers to reduce solving times and solve more problems.
